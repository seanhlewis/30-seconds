30 Seconds is a fun, time-limit puzzle game where a cat chases a shiny key through many short puzzles.

Dropped into a tiny room with only one exit, you will solve tantalizing puzzles and surpass each obstacle to get to your goal, catnip. The only thing that stands in your way is each dreadful locked door. You can get past it with your curiosity, and some luck, as well.
